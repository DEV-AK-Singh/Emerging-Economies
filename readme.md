## Project Overview

Under the guidance of Prof. Sanket Mohapatra (IIM Ahmedabad), we created the website **“At a Glance: India and Other Emerging Economies”** during our 3rd year college internship. This website compares a few key economic and financial indicators for selected emerging economies, including India. These indicators document the countries' economic performance, financial markets, financial access, and human development trends.

## Features

- **Economic Performance:** Track and compare GDP, inflation rates, and other vital statistics.
- **Financial Markets:** Overview of stock market indices, bond markets, and other financial data.
- **Financial Access:** Analysis of banking penetration, credit availability, and more.
- **Human Development Trends:** Compare literacy rates, life expectancy, and other key indicators.

## Technology Stack

### Backend

The backend is developed using **Node.js** and the **Express Framework**. It is responsible for:

- Fetching data from open-source APIs such as IMF, World Bank, and UNDP.
- Cleaning and processing the data before sending it to the frontend.

### Frontend

The frontend is created using:

- **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**: For basic structure and interactivity.
